**Disclaimer**

This blog is a subjective description of my life and my thoughts on the world. This blog is a snapshot of my thoughts when I post them, this does not necessarily reflect my current thoughts. This blog does not reflect the views of my employer and other affiliated organizations, current and past.

I will rarely edit posts when my opinion changes. This is because:

  1. My opinions change and evolve. I should not be ashamed of my past opinions, but rather embrace that I can change my opinion when new information presents itself.
  2. Going through all my previous posts and see if I still agree with them will take more time than I have.

Do you feel offended by the content of this blog? Please let me know so we can work this out.
