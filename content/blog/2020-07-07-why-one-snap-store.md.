The Snap package manager is the basis of the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/store), one of the universal app stores on Linux. Flatpak is often compared with Snap, and rightfully so: from the user's perspective both Snap and Flatpak make it possible to install the latest version of many Linux applications on almost any distribution. Though there is one difference between the two that sticks out like a sore thumb. Flatpak is designed to connect to multiple online stores at the same time. Flathub is the most popular store at the moment, but many distributions such as Fedora and Elementary OS also have their own Flatpak store. This is not the case with Snap: *there is only a single Snap Store*, and snap itself is designed to only connect to one snap store. Why is that?






Snap is largely developed by Canonical, the company which creates Ubuntu. Canonical, for a very long time, has tried to make it easier for third-party app developers to package their apps for Ubuntu. Next to the Snap Store, their most successful attempt at this are PPA's or "Personal Package Archives". Each PPA is a tiny online repository containing the applications of a single publisher. This works very well together with the `apt` package manager which it is designed to install software from multiple repositories. If a user wants to install additional software from third party developers, the user only adds the repository of that developer and then installs their software using `apt`. With PPA's Canonical made it as easy as possible for third party developers to maintain such repositories. The idea at that time was "The biggest hurdle for developers is setting up their own repository and automatic builds. If we automate this, the problem of app distribution on Ubuntu is solved". A lot of work was put into Launchpad to provide a completely free build and hosting service for PPA's. Which brings us to today: PPA's are very popular and completely automated. However, there are still many applications which are not available in PPA's, the problem is clearly not solved.






The only thing the hardcoded assertions key currently enforces is that each `snapd` instance is only connected to _a single_ snap store. A different distribution like Manjaro could very well ship a modified snapd to their users which points at their own store. Manjaro chose to use the snap store hosted by Canonical because they like the advantages that gives them. This is no different from how Linux Mint used to point `apt` on their devices to the Ubuntu repo's in the beginning and switched to their own repo's after a while. Manjaro will be able to switch to their own snap store if that makes sense to them. *Note that this is exactly what the Ubuntu Touch project did. They are using "click", the precursor to snap, and they created [their own store](https://open-store.io/) and Canonical helped them with the transition from the Canonical store to their own store.*

So I strongly disagree that "any open-source 3rd-party effort is pointless". Snapd is a great package manager and any distribution can take advantage of that, just like they already do with `apt`.

However, in this context, there are two limitations in snapd that `apt` doesn't have:

1. There is no user-accessible config to change the snap store. This is something that would be trivial to add to snapd if people are interested in running other stores, though this feature would need a lot of design work to make sure that the user experience of switching to a different store is good. *For example: what happens with the already installed snaps? Given that on some devices, the kernel itself is also a snap, this is an important issue to solve before making it possible for users to change this.*
2. Each device can only use a single store at one time.

The second point was a conscious design choice by the snapd developers with two main motivations:

* The first motivation is that having only one store per device solves a lot of the user experience issues that ppa's have. Note that this is not "everyone using snap should use the Canonical store". What they actually want is "every device using snap should only use a single store", regardless of who runs that store. Canonical's experience with ppa's showed them the disadvantages of having each device connect to multiple separate "stores". Flatpak is currently experiencing the same issues; hence their push to get as much apps as possible into Flathub, instead of each publisher hosting their own Flatpak repo like they did in the beginning.
* The second motivation is that having only one store makes a lot of stuff easier to implement. The snapd developers have not implemented this functionality to make their jobs a lot easier. Though on this forum some snapd developers have showed that they are open to the idea of someone else adding this functionality to snapd. They will simply not add it themselves.
