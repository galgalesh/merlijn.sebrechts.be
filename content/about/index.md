I'm a PHD researcher and Teaching Assistant at Ghent University - IDLab - imec. My research specializes in solving big data challenges using cloud modelling languages. As a passionate user of and contributor to open source technologies, I like to stand on the shoulders of giants to solve the challenges of tomorrow.

I love learning from smart people at conferences and building relationships with open-source communities. I'm a regular at FOSDEM and the Juju Charmers Summit. I've also attended cfgmgmtcamp, pragmatic docker days, and many more conferences.

I like to use open source projects in strange and interesting ways. As a board member of Hackerspace Ghent, I help organize the yearly Newline hacker conference and several Î¼cons.
